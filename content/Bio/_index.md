Daisuke Nakamura is a master's student in Communication Science at the University of Vienna, Austria, and a Research Assistant to Univ.-Prof. Dr. Annie Waldherr at the Computational Communication Science Lab.

His research interests includes political communication, polarization, radicalization, and computational methods. He is particularly interested in short-form video content on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok, with an emphasis on political influencers, their formats (such as podcasts and short lectures), language use, and presentation of themselves, how these elements of content shape individuals' perceptions and emotions toward their ingroups and outgroups, and how such dynamics can be analyzed and measured using computational methods.

He earned his BA in Law and Politics with Distinction from Kyoto University, Japan, in 2024. In 2022, he studied liberal arts and sciences as an exchange student at the University of Melbourne, Australia.
